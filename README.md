## Style Guide
The goal is to keep the website as simple and clean. The selection of the color theme with blue is because research shows that the color blue represents a sense of calmness and trust. In addition, we want to make sure that our website account aspects of accessbility, choose color contrast that makes it ok for people who are colorblind. Also, if you input images, make sure you include explain it in the "alt" attribute inside the image tag so that screen readers can explain to those who are blind, what image was supposed to be there. For example, if it's a photo a someone, write that person's name down.

* If you're updating an image or adding another card and image for the People section, the image size is 800x480 pixels (please edit in Photoshop or another image editor and keep color tone of the images consistant)
* Images in the About, Meeting Info, Projects and Teams sections, it's 1024Ã—436 pixels
